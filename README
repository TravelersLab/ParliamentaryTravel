# Parliamentary Travel

This repository tries to explain my process in analyzing the travel data of Burgesses and Knights of the Shire to Parliaments in the late Medieval period.

The R files are as follows :

### `code/0-dataimport.R`

In this file, I clean the data given to me on the Parliamentary Boroughs from which the Burgesses originate, and I add lat/long data to it programmatically using the R function `geocode` from `ggmap`, which queries the `Google Maps API` to obtain the data.

Additionally, I have put all data files within the data directory, within which `DataDict.md` explains what each column responds to (where known).
